# A1. An Even Easier Introduction to CUDA

Read the blog post here: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/

## General Instructions

1. Make many small commits as you go through each step.
2. Add your .cu files:

- add.cu
- add_block.cu
- add_grid.cu

3. Upload profiling results. This can be a [Markdown] or plain text table or a
data file (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets) with a image figure (png, jpg, etc).
Note, these may be impacted by other students running on the GPU at the same time.

## Keroppi Login Instructions

You can access the GPU server for this course ('keroppi') using ssh:

`ssh yourSmithUserName@keroppi`

You can run this command in either Terminal (MacOS) or PowerShell/Command Prompt (Windows).
Your password is set to your 99 number but must be changed upon login.
You will need to be on campus or logged in via the VPN to the Smith network.

### Editors

I have installed several command line (CLI) editors:

- vi/vim
- nano
- micro
- emacs

Please let me know if there are any others you would like installed.
Also, I've posted a short tutorial on using VS Code on Moodle.

## Extras

You can [install CUDA locally] if you have an NVIDIA GPU.

<!-- or a cloud service -->
